###Getting the Source

The source for Paper GTK3 Theme can be found [here](https://github.com/snwh/paper-gtk-theme).

Alternatively, you can clone the latest version its git repository:

    git clone https://github.com/snwh/paper-gtk-theme.git

###Using the Source

There are scripts to simplify the rendering process;to run them (and edit icons) you will need:

 * inkscape
 * python3

To render new assets from their source SVG files, run the following:

    ./render-gtk3-assets.py
    ./render-gtk3-assets-hidpi.py
    ./render-metacity-assets.py
    ./render-gnome-shell-assets.py
    ./render-unity-assets.py

If it's throwing an error, the script may not be executable, try:
	
	chmod +x *

This script will look in the source directories (../src/*) and render the respective icons (provided there are changes).
